# Vaiobook
A project to install mac on Sony Vaio laptops
Currently only covers the Sony Vaio S series, including all SA/SB/SC models.
Support for other sandy bridge based series may be added.

## Installation

If you are looking for installation instructions, this isn't the place for you. Try my thread on the tonymacx86 forum, <http://www.tonymacx86.com/viewtopic.php?f=170&t=41669>

## Development

The dsdt's can be compiled with IASL (<http://www.acpica.org/downloads/>)

### Compiling

	iasl DSDT_1600x900.dsl

### Decompiling

	iasl -d DSDT_1600x900.aml

## Need to do:

+ Battery code needs to be rewritten to match lion. Currently only working with older kexts. See <http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=272459>
+ Expose Thermal control strategy options to mac, would greatly improve noise levels

Any help is greatly appreciated, feel free to fork and send a pull request!
